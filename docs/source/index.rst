DeepPurpose documentation!
================================
Welcome! This is the documentation for DeepPurpose. 
DeepPurpose is a Deep Learning Based Drug Repurposing and Virtual Screening Toolkit (using PyTorch). 
It allows very easy usage (only one line of code!) for non-computational domain researchers to be able to obtain a list of potential drugs using deep learning while facilitating deep learning method research in this topic by providing a flexible framework (less than 10 lines of codes!) and baselines. 
The Github repository is located `here <https://github.com/kexinhuang12345/DeepPurpose>`_.
