What is Drug Target Interaction? 
================================================


Identifying Drug-Target Interactions (DTI) will greatly narrow down
the scope of search of candidate medications, 
and thus can plays a pivotal role in drug discovery. 
Drugs usually interact with one or more proteins to achieve their functions. 
However, discovering novel interactions between drugs 
and target proteins is crucial for the development of new drugs, 
since the aberrant expression of proteins may cause side effects of drugs. 



Considering that in vitro experiments are extremely costly and time-consuming, 
high efficiency computational prediction methods could 
serve as promising strategies for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction. 
In this project, our goal is to focus on deep learning approaches 
for drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction.
